# Signal-Management-Systems
 Smart Traffic Signal System uses AI (YOLOv5) and Python (Pygame) to adjust signal timings based on real-time traffic density. It reduces congestion, idle time, and emissions through adaptive control and simulation. This scalable solution supports smarter, sustainable urban traffic management.
